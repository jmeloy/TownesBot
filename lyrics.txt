XWhy does she sing her sad songs for me, I'm not the one 
To tenderly bring her soft sympathy, I've just begun
To see my way clear and it's plain if I stop I will fallX
I can lay down a tear for her pain, just a tear and that's allX
What does she want me to do
She says that she knows that moments are rare
I suppose that it's trueX
Then on she goes to say I don't care 
and she knows that I doX
Maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the song
Who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrongX
She'd like to think that I'm cruel but she knows that's a lie 
for I would be 
No more than a tool if I allowed her to cry all over meX
My sorrow is real even though I can't change my plans
If she could see how I feel 
then I know that she'd understandX
Does she actually think I'm to blame
Does she really believe that some word of mine
Could relieve all her painX
Can't she see that she grieves just because 
she's been blindly deceived 
By her shameX
Maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the song
Who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrongX
Nothin's what it seems, maybe she'll start someday to realize
If she abandons her dreams then all the words she can say are only liesX
When will she see that to gain is only to lose
All that she offers me are her chains, I got to refuseX
It's only to herself that she's lied
She likes to pretend there's something that she should defend with her pride
I don't intend to stand her and be the friend from whom she must hideX
Maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the song
Who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrongX
The name she gave was Caroline
daughter of a miner
her ways were freeX
it seemed to me
that sunshine walked beside herX
She came from Spencer
across the hill
she said her pa had sent her
'cause the coal was low
and soon the snow
would turn the skies to winterX
She said she'd come
to look for work
she was not seeking favors
and for a dime a day
and a place to stay
she'd turn those hands to laborX
But the times were hard, Lord,
the jobs were few
all through Tecumseh valleyX
but she asked around
and a job she found
tending bar at Gypsy Sally'sX
She saved enough to get back home
when spring replaced the winter
but her dreams were denied
her pa had died
the word come down from SpencerX
So she turned to whorin' out on the streets
with all the lust inside her
and it was many a man
returned again
to lay himself beside herX
They found her down beneath the stairs
that led to Gypsy Sally's
in her hand when she died
was a note that cried
fare thee well...Tecumseh valleyX
The name she gave was Caroline
daughter of a miner
her ways were free
it seemed to me
that sunshine walked beside herX
It's many a fine lady has laid down beside me
With their flesh made of velvet and their eyes made of rainX
Some tried to hold me, to hurt me, to hide me
Some turned away not to look back again
One stood among them, I remember most clearly
Her sorrows were heavy and her laughter was slowX
I courted her gently, for I loved her most dearly
And I came her majestic reflections to know
Her words like the mountain, stood lonely and lofty
With her face like a daydream and her hair like the shawlX
Worn by a mourner, who steals away softly
From those that would have him mourn nothing at all
Endlessly sorrow rode high on the north wind
Slashing and slicing, to take him his tollX
Endlessly creatures of darkness were cutting
Their paths through the walls that shelter the soul
No longer gypsy-like sadness unending
Her eyes they lie hollow and her face petrifiedX
Some will go laughing and others condemning
But who there among you could have told her goodbye
It's many a fine lady has laid down beside me
With their flesh made of velvet and their eyes made of rainX
Some tried to hold me, to hurt me, to hide me
Some turned away not to look back againX
Well, the diamonds fades quickly when matched to the face of Maria
All the harps they sound empty when she lifts her lips to the skyX
the brown of her skin makes her hair seem a soft golden rainfall
that spills from the mountains to the bottomless depths of her eyesX
Well, she stands all around me her hands slowly sifting the sunshine
all the laughter that linger down deep 'neath her smilin' is freeX
Well, it spins and it twirls like a hummingbird lost in the morning
and caresses the south wind and silently sails to the seaX
Ah, the sculpter stands stricken and the artist he throws away his brushes
when her image comes dancin' the sun she turns sullen with shameX
And the birds they go silent the wind stops his sad mournful singing
when the trees of the forest start gently to whisper'in her nameX
So as softly she wanders I'll desperately follow her footsteps
and I'll chase after shadows that offer a trace of her sightX
Ah, they promise eternally that she lays hidden within them
but I find they've decieved me and sadly I bid them goodbyeX
So the serpent slide softly away with these moments of laughter
and the the old washy woman has finish her cleanin' and goneX
but the bamboo hang heavy in the bondage of quicksilver daydreams
and a lonely child longingly looks for a place to belongX
Sometimes I don't know where this dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I can't even see the reason whyX
I guess I keep on gamblin', lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
It's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to dieX
One-time friends I had a ma, I even had a pa
He beat her with a belt once cause she criedX
She told him to take care of me, she headed down to Tennessee
It's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to dieX
I came of age and found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and hit it on the slyX
I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine and hopped a train
Seemed easier than just a-waitin' 'round to dieX
A friend said he knew where some easy money was
We robbed a man and brother did we flyX
The posse caught up with me, drug me back to Muskogee
It's two long years, just a-waitin' 'round to dieX
Now I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last
He don't steal or cheat or drink or lieX
His name's codeine, he's the nicest thing I've seen
Together we're gonna wait around and dieX
There's no stronger wind than the one that blows
down a lonesome railroad lineX
No prettier sight than looking back
on a town you left behindX
There is nothin' that's as real
as a love that's in my mind"
Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
close your eyes
I'll be here for a whileX
There's lots of things along the road
I'd surely like to seeX
I'd like to lean into the wind
and tell myself I'm freeX
but your softest whisper's louder
than the highways call to meX
All the mountains and the rivers
and the valleys can't compare
to your blue lit dancin' eyes
and yellow shining hairX
I could never hit the open road
and leave you layin' there
Lay your head back easy, love,
close your cryin' eyesX
I'll be layin' here beside you
when the sun comes on the rise
I'll stay as long as the cuckoo wails
and the lonesome bluejay cries.X
When the bandits have stolen your jewelry and gone
and your crippled young gypsy, he's grown tall and strongX
and your dead misconceptions have proven you wrong
well then, princess, where you plannin' to turn to?X
when your magazine memory has spun you around
and you realize your lovers were just painted clownsX
and outside your window you start hearing sounds
where they're building a cross for to burn you
when all your bright scarlet turn slowly to blue
will you stop and decide that it's over?X
When your teardrops go sour and no longer fall
the splash cross the virgin that lives down your hall
and spends all her nights with an ear to your wall
well then, what will you have you can offer?X
When the firedancers finish and leave you alone
with nothing but embers and sacks full of stone
that hang round your neck, slicing through to the bone
will there still be place for your laughter?X
As your shattered illusions come a-tumblin' home
and all of the butchers you've nourished have grown
and they are suddenly able to leave you alone
and they run like slaves that are set freeX
when your questions are answered and your pleading is done
and your mind starts to screaming that you ain't the one
that once dwelled within you, will you turn, will you run
Then princess, will you come home and get me?X
I'll play upon my violin
until the mountains ring
of lonely laughter blindly thrown
and cause an endless arc of stringsX
the skies are sad
they're dancin' to a silent symphony
and the velvet voices all shall join
the singingX
The hall is filled to every corner
by a tinkling hint of chimes
a melody careens and crumbles
leaving just a trace behindX
a rhythm [palter and] faintly fails
the silver on its wings
and the velvet voices all shall join
the singingX
The cymbals flash, the drums they crash
the trumpets rise the song
the brass beton plucks its diamonds
from a glittering wall of almost dawnX
The crystal chords they slash the wind
in humble majesty
and the velvet voices all shall join
the singingX
You live on your hill so high and so lonely
You toss out your bread crumbs to those down below
They think you're a king but believe me it's only
Because they're too blind to knowX
There once was a time when your money had meaning
Your diamonds had glitter but now it's all gone
It poisoned your laughter and muffled your singingX
You can't even see that it's wrong
Your castle is dingy and dirty and dismal
Your carpets are faded, your walls are all greyX
There's dust on your silver and cracks in your crystal
All your young servants have drifted away
So go back to your sadness, go back to your sorrowX
And i'll make my bed on a hill 'neath the sky
And lay here a-listening 'till the sun comes tomorrowX
Counting the tears that you cry
Your castle is dingy and dirty and dismal
Your carpets are faded, your walls are all greyX
There's dust on your silver and cracks in your crystal
All your young servants have drifted away
Well, I ain't very big for twenty-one
and it seems like I never could have any good clean funX
cause every time I'd go outside some great big bully'd come along
he'd hit me in the face and he'd knock to the groundX
and he'd start to kickin' me all around
and that ain't exactly fair, friends, that's wrong.X
So I got me a paper the other night
and I crawled up on the sofa and I turned on the lightX
and I flipped through the pages till I found the classified ads.
Said, 'take karate from Lee Hung Chow;
man, make your first appointment now
this course is guaranteed to make you bad.'X
Well, the next day I drove to the address
and by japanese design I was really impressedX
it looked like a regular house of the rising sun
I walked inside, I was all aloneX
I had a nervous feeling down in my bones
I was kind of sorry that I'd ever even comeX
Well, he grabbed me by the hand and he gave a heave
I figured there's a pretty good time to leave
before he had a chance to do me any definite harm.X
But my plan worked out in the end you see
now no bully is gonna pick on me
who's gonna hit a fellow with just one armX
Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl I knew
fair of skin with eyes of blueX
I swear to the Lord that I loved her true
it's a year now she's been gone
Her spirit was as bright as the soft sunshine
lips the color strawberry wineX
I wish to God she still was mine
The chance won't come againX
After first we lay in love's sweet bed
with one look at her eyes I might have read
all the pain that was flying through her headX
through my guilt I could not see
I turned to her when the morning came
hungry thoughts racing through my brainX
but the knife in her heart screamed herself she'd slain
and a note whispered love too soon
Her old man screamed and her mother cried
all I could do was to wonder whyX
a girl in her youth was forced to die
is loving such a crime
She died few in the years her breasts still small
seeing sixteens summers and fifteen fallsX
me in my blindness never realized all
the fear she kept insideX
Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl I knew
fair of skin with eyes of blue
I swear to the Lord that I loved her true
Your eyes seek conclusion in all this confusion of mineX
Though you and I both know it's only the warm glow of wine
That's got you to feeling this way, but I don't care,
I want you to stay
and hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me todayX
Children are dancin', the gamblers are chancin' their all
The window's accusing the door of abusing the wallX
But who cares what the night watchmen say
The stage has been set for the play
Hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me todayX
The moon's come and gone but a few stars hang on on to the sky
The wind's runnin' free but it ain't up to me ask whyX
The poets are demanding their pay
They've left me with nothin' to sayX
'cept hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today
Just hold me and tell me that you'll be here to love me todayX
It's plain to see, the sun won't shine today
but I ain't in the mood for sunshine anywayX
maybe I'll go insane
I got to stop the pain
Or maybe I'll go down to see Kathleen.X
A swallow comes and tells me of her dreams
She says she'd like to know just what they meanX
I feel like I could die
as I watch her flying by
ride the north wind down to see Kathleen.X
Stars hang high above, the oceans roar
the moon is come to lead me to her doorX
There's crystal across the sand
and the waves, they take my hand.
Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen.
Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen.X
She came and she touched me
with hands made of heaven
reflections sent spinnin'
through a face laced in mistX
Now I stand where she left me
buried deep 'neath her shadow
and the mirror plead sadly
does it all come to this
and I wonder: Will she call my name?X
The wind careens madly
through wide windows paneless
fragrancies mingle
in a room full of shadeX
The peons pick partners
and waltz cross the ceilings
but the violins whisper
that I've been betrayed
tryin not to look ashamedX
The drunkards drink deeply
from cups full of nothingness
ghost lovers laugh
at the games that they playX
the moments do somersaults
into eternity
cling to their coattails
and beg them to stay
saying I got nothing to hideX
Illusions projected
on walls made of Tiffany
mad menuets to
a sad satin songX
A harlequin mandolins
harmonize helplessly
hoping that endlessly
won't last for long
Praying that their God ain't dyingX
Then I turn and I see her
in a dress made of moonlight
teardrops like diamonds
run slow down her faceX
her arms surround me
like chains made of velvet
and the demons fall faithfully
into their place
and the rivers run with jewelsX
Now the morning lies open
the night went quite quickly
memory harmlessly
fractures and fadesX
All the poets do push-ups
on carpets of rubber foam
loudly they laugh
at some joke that's been made
and the wise men speak like foolsX
Her face was crystal
fair and fine
her breath was morning
her lips were wine
her eyes were laughter
her touch divineX
her face was crystal
and she was mineX
If only she
could feel my pain
but feelin' is a burden
she can't sustainX
so like a summer thursday
I cry for rain
to come and turn
the ground to green againX
If only she
could hear my songs
'bout the empty difference
'tween the rights and wrongsX
then I know that I
could stand alone
as well as they
now that she's goneX
Her face was crystal
fair and fine
her breath was morning
her lips were wineX
her eyes were laughter
her touch divine
her face was crystal
and she was mineX
My lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom
the moon's dancin' purple
all through her black hairX
and a ladies-in-waiting she stands 'neath my window
and the sun will rise soon
on the false and the fairX
She tells me she comes from my mother the mountain
her skin fits her tightly
and her lips do not lieX
She silently slips from her throat a medallion
slowly she twirls it
in front of my eyesX
I watch her, I love her, I long for to touch her
the satin she's wearin'
is shimmering blueX
Outside my window her ladies are sleeping
my dogs have gone hunting
the howling is throughX
So I reach for her hand and her eyes turns to poison
and her hair turns to splinters,
and her flesh turns to brineX
she leaps cross the room, she stands in the window
and screams that my first-born
will surely be blindX
She throws herself out to the black of the nightfall
She's parted her lips
but she makes not a soundX
I fly down the stairway, and I run to the garden
no trace of my true love
is there to be foundX
So walk these hills lightly, and watch who you're lovin'
by mother the mountain
I swear that it's trueX
Love not a woman with hair black as midnight
and her dress made of satin
all shimmering blueX
You're wakin' next to me
tears splash across the sun
you whisper soft to me
that I ain't the only one
to breathe your yellow hair
caress your bosom fairX
Do you think I really care?
Do you think it matters?
What do your feelin's mean?
Do you think I'd love more
if you stood pure and clean
of those you'd known beforeX
Would your words be sweeter then
upon November's wind
if you began again
could your smile be softer?X
Would your eyes more brightly shine?
Would your laughter be so tender
if you'd been only mine
for as long as you remember?X
I don't want tears from you
don't build your love on shame
all what we've done is through
and all we can do remainsX
my lady can't you see
I love not jealously
but for all you are to me
and all you'll be tomorrowX
When she had twenty years she turned to her mother
saying Mother, I know that you'll grieve
but I've given my soul to St John the gambler
tomorrow comes time leaveX
for the hills cannot hold back my sorrow forever
and dead men lay deep 'round the door
the only salvation thats mine for the asking
so mother, think on me no moreX
Winter held high round the mountains breast
and the cold of a thousand snows
lay heaped upon the forests leaf
but she dressed in calicoX
for a gambler likes his women fancy
fancy she would be
and the fire of her longing would keep way the cold
and her dress was a sight to seeX
But the road was long beneath the feet
she followed her frozen breath
in search of a certain St John the gambler
stumbling to her deathX
she heard his laughter right down from the mountains
and danced with her mothers tears
to a funeral drawn a calico
'neath the cross of twenty yearsX
Mr. Ten Dollar man
Let me tell where you're bound
Drink your green liqour, Lord
You'll roll to the groundX
But you come around here
With your money in your hand
Taste of my woman
You die where you standX
Snake Mountain blues
They got me down low
I could die in the morningX
But none would know
My woman come 'round
My body she'd find
Go down to Dundee
Have her a timeX
Snake Mountain's
Gonna crumble Lord
And fall from the sky
Before that woman of mine
Stops tellin' her liesX
If I'd die Lord she'd weep
She'd weep and she'd mourn
Soon as I's buried
Forget I'd been bornX
My Daddy, Lord he rides
On a long holy trainX
First winds of winter
I'll see him again
It's farewell to this yellow
Headed misery I've knownX
Snake Mountain's callin'
Callin' me homeX
Snake Mountain blues
They got me down low
I could die in the mornin'
No one would knowX
My woman come around
My body she'd find
Go down to Dundee
Have her a timeX
My home is Colorado
with their proud mountains tall
where the rivers like gypsys
down her black canyons fallX
I'm a long, long way from Denver
with a long way to go
so lend an ear to my singing
cause I'll be back no moreX
I left as a young man
not full seventeen
with nothin' for company
but the wind and a dreamX
'bout all the fast ladies
and livin' I'd find
when I left my proud mountains
and rivers behindX
So I rolled and a-rambled
like a leaf in the wind
Well, I found my fast ladies
and some hard livin' menX
Well, I sometimes went hungry
with my pockets all bare
Lord, I sometimes had good luck
with money to spareX
I made me some friends, Lord,
that I won't soon forget
Some are down under
and some are rambling yetX
but as for me
I'm headed for home
back to high Colorado
never more for to roamX
So friends, when my time comes
as surely it will
you just carry my body
out to some lonesome hillX
and lay me down easy
where the cool rivers run
with only my mountains
'tween me and the sunX
My home is Colorado
Like silent she stands
like laughter she falls
from a castle of sand
like a memory she crawlsX
and the mockingbirds grieve
'cause they can't make her cry
they'll soon start to believe
that the lady has diedX
what it all goes to show
it ain't my job to say
for who am I to know
why she's actin' this wayX
Once again turn away
if you're sure that it's done
tell your prophets to pray
tell your bandits to runX
take your eyelids of stone
they won't do you no harm
take your cross made of bones
take your your fly-paper armsX
and when everything's placed
in your coffin and go
through a scarf 'round your face
'cause the subway gets coldX
pack up your sunflower smile
and your bandana blues
take your worthless denials
they're all you've got left to loseX
take your Tinkerbell lies
and your weary desires
take the tears in your eyes
take your cup full of fireX
give your lover a call
if your legs start to fail
and he'll come break your fall
with a bed full of nailsX
No need to glance back again
there ain't nothin' to see
just this drunken old man
and this woman and meX
and you've made it quite plain
that we're just wastin' time
and you say that it seems strange
that I'm staying behindX
but you don't worry 'bout me
I can make it alone
'cause I got no place to be
and I ain't far from homeX
Tossin' hair a-ravin'
eyes of flashin' blue
all the livin' that you're savin'
won't buy you dreams for youX
Cut yourself a columbine
tear it from the stem
now breathe upon the petals fine
and throw them to the windX
Watch the petals dancin'
see them twirl and sing
all your pride and prancin'
how much does it mean?X
Watch the petals start to fly
and then come falling down
hear the wind begin to cry
as she sees some touch the groundX
Ah, lady, like the flower fair
some day you'll have to fall
and you can find me standin' there
to catch you if you crawlX
Tossin' hair a-ravin'
eyes of flashin' blue
all the livin' that you're savin'
won't buy you dreams for youX
Don't you take it too bad
if you're feelin' unlovin'
if you're feelin unfeelin'
if you're feelin' alone
Don't take it too badX
'Cause it ain't you to blame, babe
Lord, it's just some kind of game made
out of all of this living
that we got left to doX
And if you go searchin'
for rhyme or for reason
then you won't have the time
that it take just for talkin'X
about the places you've been, babe
about the places you've seen, babe
and how soft the time flies
past your window at nightX
And we just can't have that, girl
'cause it's a sad, lonesome, cold worldX
and a man need a woman just to stand by his side
and whisper sweet words in his ears about daydreams
and roses and playthings
and the sweetness of springtime
and the sound of the rainX
I'm goin' out to Denver
see if I can't find
I'm goin' out to Denver
see if I can't find
that lovin' Colorado girl of mineX
The promise in her smile
shames the mountains tall
she bring the sun to shining
tell the rain to fallX
It's been a long time, mama,
since I heard you call my name
I got to see my Colorado girl again
Be there tomorrow
Mama, don't you cryX
I got to kiss these
lonesome Texas blues good-bye
I'm goin' out to to Denver
see if I can't find
that lovin' Colorado girl of mineX
Well, won't you lend your lungs to me?
Mine are collapsingX
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe
up the time that's passing.X
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give
pray the day ain't poison
stand among the ones that live
in lonely indecision.X
Fingers walk the darkness down
mind is on the midnight
gather up the gold you've found
you fool, it's only moonlight.X
If you try to take it home
your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone
try to find another.X
Salvation sat and crossed herself
called the devil partner
wisdom burned upon a shelf
who'll kill the raging cancerX
Seal the river at its mouth
take the water prisoner
fill the sky with screams and cries
bathe in fiery answersX
Jesus was an only son
and love his only conceptX
strangers cry in foreign tongues
and dirty up the doorstepX
and I for one, and you for two
ai'nt got the time for outsideX
just keep your injured looks to you
we'll tell the world we triedX
The drunken clown's still hanging round
but it plain the laughter's all died down
the tears you tried so hard to hide
are flowin'X
A blind man with his knife in hand
has convinced himself that he understands
I wish him well, Miss Carousel
but I gotta be a-goin'X
Won't you come and get me when
you're sure that you don't need me then
I stand outside your window
and proudly call your nameX
The ladies been told that all of gold
is worth so much it can't be sold
No time to weep she'll need her sleep
tomorrowX
When she carries her face to the market place
and bets it on the opening race
she can ring her bells, Miss Carousel,
but her singing brings me sorrowX
It's always done every mother's son
is shown that grown men never run
and so they fight with all the might
inside themX
When the battle's been fought and they all been taught
that the trick is just not being caught
Will you give them hell, Miss Carousel,
when they're begging you to hide themX
When the need arose your eyes fell closed
you clamped your fingers round your nose
Would you say that's any way
to judge himX
You haven't got the authority
to kill him in the first degree
but would you feel compelled, Miss Carousel,
if you have something to begrudge himX
On a velvet beach far beneath the reach
of those that come to pray and preach
The natural man who tries to stand
is fallinX
How long will it be before he sees
you own his legs but his mind is free
Only you can tell, Miss Carousel,
how long will he be crawling?X
The castle walls has grown so tall
seem there ain't no hope at all
to reach the top even though you stop
for breathin'X
But I ain't gonna try to make you cry
the tear drops couldn't find your eye
It's all been swell, Miss Carousel,
but the time has come for leavin'X
We had our day but now it's over
we had our song but now it's sung
we had our stroll through summers clover
but summer's gone now, our walkin's doneX
So tell me gently who be your lover
who be your lover after I'm goneX
will it be the moon that hears your sighin'
will it be the willow that hears your lonesome song
Will it be the rain that clings to your bosomX
will it be the sunshine that dries your golden hair
will it be the wind that warns of my returning
will a rose be in your arms when I find you waitin' thereX
None but the rain should cling to my bosom
none but the moon should hear my lonesome sigh
none but the wind should warn of your returningX
Fare thee well, my love, good-bye
So close and yet so far away
And all the things I'd hoped to say
Will have to go unsaid today
Perhaps until tomorrowX
Your fears have built a wall between
Our lives and all what loving means
Will have to go unfelt it seems
And that leaves only sorrowX
You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see, it's got to fall someday
You close your eyes and speak to me
Of faith and love and destiny
As distant as eternity
From truth and understandingX
The wind blows cold outside your door
It whispers words I've tried before
But you don't hear me anymore
Your pride's just too demandingX
You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see, it's got to fall someday
The end is coming soon it's plainX
A warm bed just ain't worth the pain
And I will go and you'll remain
With the bitterness we've tastedX
A mother's breast, a newborn child
A poet's tear and drunken smile
I can't help feelin' all the while
Their meaning won't be wastedX
You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see, it's got to fall somedayX
I got a brand new companion
man, I'm gonna do my best this time
you know she cools me with her breathin'
chases away those howlin' bottles of wineX
She fits just like my guitar
man, she's near as tall as me
she lives way out the D train
but she's Texas as can beX
She got a home-spun disposition
man, she's just as gentle as you please
she got arms just like two rattle snakes
legs just like a billow in the breezeX
I got a brand new companion
man, I'm gonna do my best this time
I want to trace her with my body
I want to track her with my mindX
Won't say I love you babe
Won't say I need you babe
But, I'm gonna get you babe
And I will not do you wrongX
Livin's mostly wastin' time
I waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's don't take too longX
You're soft as glass
And I'm a gentle man
We got the sky to talk about
And the world to lie upon.X
Days up and down they come
Like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some
But don't turn none awayX
Everything is not enough
Nothin' is to much to bear
Where you been is good and gone
All you keep is the gettin' thereX
To live is to fly
Low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyesX
It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
Think on all the poetry
And the pickin' down the lineX
I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don't pay to think too muchX
On things you leave behind
I may be gone
But it won't be long
I will be a-bringin' back the melodyX
And the rhythm that I find
We all got holes to fill
Them holes are all that's real
Some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your ownX
But choice is yours to make
And time is yours to take
Some dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stoneX
To live is to fly
Low and high,
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyesX
Living on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath's as hard as keroseneX
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreamsX
Pancho was a bandit boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feelX
Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
That's the way it goesX
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him hang around
Out of kindness I supposeX
Lefty he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouthX
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knowsX
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness I supposeX
The poets tell how Pancho fell
Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
So the story ends we're toldX
Pancho needs your prayers it's true,
But save a few for Lefty too
He just did what he had to do
Now he's growing oldX
A few gray federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him go so wrong
Out of kindness I supposeX
If I needed you
would you come to me,
would you come to me,
and ease my pain?X
If you needed me
I would come to you
I'd swim the seas
for to ease your painX
In the night forlorn
the morning's born
and the morning shines
with the lights of loveX
You will miss sunrise
if you close your eyes
that would break
my heart in twoX
The lady's with me now
since I showed her how
to lay her lily
hand in mineX
Loop and Lil agree
she's a sight to see
and a treasure for
the poor to findX
Of those that sailed the silver ships
from Andilar I am the last
The deeds that rang our youthful dreams
it seems shall go undoneX
North for the shores of Valinor
our bows and crimson sails were made
Our captains were strong, our lances long
and our liege the holy kingX
The hills did turn from green to blue
and vanish as on the decks we watched
But every thought in that noble company
was forward boundX
To the lifeless plains of Valinor
where reigns the dark and frozen one
And with tongues afire and glorious eyes
we pledged our mission beX
The clime from mild to bitter ran
the wind from fair to fierce did blow
Oath and prayer did turn to thoughts
of homes left far behindX
Longed every man for some glimpse of land
and the host that did await us there
But each new day brought only a sea
and sky of ice and grayX
Thanks give no word can drag you through
those endless weeks our ships did roll
Thanks give you cannot see those sails
and faces bleach and drawX
Ice we drank and leather did chew
for the oceans are unwholesome there
The dead that slid into the seas
did freeze before our eyesX
Then a wind did fling the ships apart
each one to go her separate way
The sky did howl, the hull did groan
for how long I do not knowX
And what men were left when the winds had ceased
grew dull and low of countenance
For soldiers denied their battle plain
on comrades soon must turnX
So one by one we died alone
some by hunger, some by steel
Bodies froze where they did fall
their souls unsanctifiedX
Until only another and I were left
then just before his flame did fail
We shone ourselves brothers-in-arms
to serve the holy kingX
Perhaps this shall reach Andilar
although I know not how it can
For once again he's hurled his wind
upon the silver prowX
But if it should my words are these
arise young men fine ships to build
And set them north for Valinor
'neath standards proud as fireX
I'm goin out on the highway
listen to them big trucks whine
White freight liner
won't you steal away my mindX
Ah, New Mexico ain't bad, Lord
and the people there they treat you kind
Well, it's bad news from Houston
half my friends are dyingX
Ah, Lord, I'm gonna ramble
till I get back to where I came
I'm goin out on the highway
listen to them big trucks whineX
Ride the blue wind high and free
She'll lead you down through misery
Leave you low come time to go
Alone and low as low can beX
If I had a nickel I'd find a game
If I won a dollar I'd make it rain
If it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry
And lay me down dissatisfiedX
It's legs to walk and thoughts to fly
Eyes to laugh and lips to cry
A restless tongue to classify
All born to grow and grown to dieX
Tell my baby I said so long
Tell my mother I did no wrong
Tell my brother to watch his own
Tell my friends to mourn me noneX
Chained upon the face of time
Feeling full of foolish rhyme
There ain't no dark till something shines
I'm bound to leave this dark behindX
Ride the blue wind high and free
She'll lead you down through misery
Leave you low come time to go
Alone and low as low can beX
Well, the clouds didn't look like cotton
they didn't even look like clouds
I was underneath the weather
my friends looked a crowdX
The swimmin' hole was full of rum
I tried to find out why
All I learned was this my friend
you got to swim before you flyX
I got two girls
one's in heaven and one's below
Oh, one I love with all my heart
and one I do not know.X
Two lonesome dudes on an ugly horse
Passed by not long ago
They asked me where the action was
I said I did not know
As they disappeared into the brushX
I heard the driver say
He's a little slow between the ears
He's always been that way.X
Jolly Jane just lays around
and listens with her mouth
she's had about a dozen husbands
but the last one pulled outX
Now, who's gonna bring her dinner
through the weary years ahead
all she'll get from me is sympathy
got no time to see she's fed.X
It's cold down on the bayou
they say it's in your mind
but the moccasins are treadin' ice
and leavin strange designsX
Cajuns say the last time
that this happend they weren't here
All Beaumont's full of penguins
and I'm a-playin' it by ear.X
If I had no place to fall
and I needed to
could I count on you
to lay me down?X
I'd never tell you no lies
I don't believe it's wise
you got pretty eyes
won't you spin me 'roundX
I ain't much of a lover it's true
I'm here then I'm gone
and I'm forever blue
but I'm sure wanting youX
Skies full of silver and gold
try to hide the sun
but it can't be done
least not for longX
And if we help each other grow
while the light of day
smiles down our way
then we can't go wrongX
Time, she's a fast old train
she's here then she's gone
and she won't come again
won't you take my handX
If I had no place to fall
and I needed to
could I count on you
to lay me down?X
I heard her sing in tongues of silver
I heard her cry on a summer storm
I loved her, but she did not know it
so I don't think about her anymoreX
Now she's gone, and I can't believe it
so I don't think about her anymoreX
If three and four was seven only
where would that leave one and two?
If love can be and still be lonely
where does that leave me and you?X
Time there was, and time there will be
where does that leave me and you?X
If I had a buckskin stallion
I'd tame him down and ride away.
If I had a flyin' schooner
I'd sail into the light of day
If I had your love forever
sail into the light of dayX
Pretty songs and pretty places
places that I've never seen
pretty songs and pretty faces
tell me what their laughter meansX
some look like they'll cry forever
tell me what their laughter means.X
If I had a buckskin stallion
I'd tame him down and ride away.
If I had a golden galleon
I'd sail into the light of dayX
If I had your love forever
sail into the light of dayX
