# TownesBot

This was a just for fun project that I did to create a Townes Van Zandt lyrics bot on twitter. Most of the original code can be attributed to Daniel Shiffman.

The basic idea is that the bot.js file will randomly parse through lyrics.txt to tweet a few lines of lyrics. I used heroku.com to automate the process.
